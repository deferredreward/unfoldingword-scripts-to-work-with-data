FIGURES OF SPEECH

Apostrophe

Luke 10:13
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!
Jesus is speaking to two cities that he knows cannot hear him. He is doing this to show in a very strong way how he feels about those cities. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the disciples whom he is sending out. If your readers might not understand why Jesus is speaking to someone who is not present, you could translate his words as if he were speaking directly to his disciples. Alternate translation: “Chorazin and Bethsaida are two of the cities whose people God will judge severely for rejecting my message”

Judges 9:29
And he said to Abimelek, “Increase your army and come out.”
Gaal is speaking to Abimelek even though he is not present and cannot hear him. Gaal is doing this to show in a strong way how he feels about Abimelek. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the others who are present at this feast. If your readers might not understand why Gaal is speaking to someone who is not present, you could translate his words as if he were speaking directly to others who are present. Alternate translation, continuing the direct quotation: “I would fight against him and his whole army and defeat him!”

Aside 

Obadiah 1:7
There is no understanding in him.
Yahweh has been telling the people of Edom what will happen to them because they did not help the people of Judah. Here he pauses to say something to himself about Edom. If it would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider translating this as Yahweh speaking about Edom. But if this way of speaking would be unclear, you can translate this as Yahweh speaking to the people of Edom, but make clear that he is now expressing his thoughts and feelings about them. Alternate translation: “You do not understand any of this”

Nehemiah 13:31
Remember me, my God, for good.
Here Nehemiah is pausing from addressing the audience that is hearing his story to speak confidentially to God in prayer about two of the characters in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show this is a prayer is distinct from the story by making it a direct quotation.

Doublet

Job 38:23
battle and war
The terms **battle** and **war** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “great warfare”

Acts 2:12
they were all amazed and perplexed
The words **amazed** and **perplexed** mean similar things. Luke is using them together to emphasize that the people could not understand what was happening. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “they were all very perplexed”

Euphemism

Luke 1:34
I have not known a man
Mary is using a polite expression to say that she has never had sexual relations with a man. If this would be misunderstood in your language, use your own polite way of referring to this or use plain language. Alternate translation: “I have never slept with a man” or “I have never had sexual relations with a man”

Acts 7:60
he fell asleep
Luke is describing the death of Stephen when he says **he fell asleep**. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant. If this would be misunderstood in your language, use your own polite way of referring to this or use plain language. Alternate translation: “he passed away” or “he died”

Hendiadys

Judges 4:20
asks you and says
This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **asks** indicates that what this person **says** will be a question. If it would be clearer in your language, you can express the same meaning with only one of these words. Alternate translation: “asks you” or “says to you”

Job 26:11
tremble and marvel
This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **marvel**, a reference to being astonished by the power of God, tells why the pillars of the heavens **tremble**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “shake with fear”

Hyperbole

Esther 1:17
all the women
To emphasize his point, Memukan makes an overstatement and says that **all the women** in the empire will hear about Queen Vashti refusing to obey King Ahasuerus. Alternate translation: “women all over the empire”

Luke 5:17
from every village of Galilee and Judea
Luke is making a generalization for emphasis. He says **every** in order to emphasize from how many different villages these religious leaders came. Alternate translation: “from villages throughout Galilee and Judea”

Idiom

Judges 9:17
and threw his life in front
Jotham is using a common expression that means that Gideon risked his life by leading the armies of Israel into battle against the Midianites. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and put his life on the line” or “and risked his life”

Acts 17:20
what these things want to be
The philosophers are using common expression whose meaning comes from the phrase taken as a whole rather than from the words understood individually. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what this is all about” or “what these things mean”

Irony

Job 12:2
Truly, then, you are the people, and wisdom will die with you
For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You are speaking as if you were the people and as if wisdom would die with you, but that is not true”

Luke 9:13
unless we go and buy food for all these people
The disciples are not making a serious suggestion here. They actually mean to communicate emphatically the opposite of the literal meaning of their words. Alternate translation: “and we certainly cannot go and buy food for all these people”

Litany

Obadiah 1:12
But you should not have looked & And you should not have rejoiced & And you should not have made
Yahweh uses a repetitive series of sentences in verses 12–14 to show how badly the people of Edom have treated the people of Judah. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” This is a list of the charges against the people of Edom. Yahweh goes on to say in verses 15 and 16 that he has found them guilty of all of these charges and that he will punish them. Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone has done wrong.

Revelation 22:11
Let the one being unrighteous still be unrighteous, and let the filthy one still be filthy, and let the righteous one still do righteousness, and let the holy one still be holy
In this verse, the angel is using a series of similar phrases in order to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. Try to translate each of these phrases in such a way as to show their similarity. You may also wish to summarize the idea behind the phrases beforehand, if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The time is so near that it is too late for people to change the way they are living. So let the one being unrighteous still be unrighteous, and let the filthy one still be filthy, and let the righteous one still do righteousness, and let the holy one still be holy”

Litotes

Job 39:24
and it does not stand still
Yahweh is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a term that is the opposite of his intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and it charges forward”

Acts 19:11
not ordinary
Luke is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a term that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “extraordinary”

Merism

Job 3:19
Small and great are there
Job is using two extremes of people, **Small** and **great**, to mean them and everyone in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “People of every kind are there”

Luke 8:34
in the city and in the countryside
Luke is referring to a whole region by naming the two constituent parts of it. Alternate translation: “throughout the whole area”

Metaphor

Job 4:8
the ones plowing misery and sowing trouble reap it
Eliphaz is speaking as if people could literally plow **misery**, sow **trouble**, and **reap** those things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “those who do wicked things and cause trouble for others will experience trouble themselves”

2 Timothy 2:3
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ
Here Paul speaks as if Timothy were a soldier who fights for and serves Jesus Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea as a comparison or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as if you were a good soldier and Jesus Christ were your commander” or “as someone who faithfully serves Jesus Christ”

Metonymy

Judges 5:30
for the necks of the spoil
Sisera’s mother is using the term **spoil** by association to mean the soldiers who are collecting this plunder after the battle. Alternate translation: “for the necks of the soldiers collecting this plunder”

Job 7:15
rather than my bones
Job is using the term **bones** to mean life, by association with the way people are supported by their bones as they live on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “rather than life” or “rather than continuing to live”

Parallelism

Esther 3:2
But Mordecai would neither bow down, nor would he prostrate himself.
These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how serious an offense this was against the king’s command and how much determination it took for Mordecai to remain standing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “But Mordecai persistently refused to bow down to Haman”

Acts 1:20
Let his habitation become desolate, and let not one dwelling be in it
These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if this might be unclear in your language, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Let his habitation be made desolate, yes, let no one dwell in it” or “Let his habitation be made completely desolate”

Personification

Judges 3:11
And the land rested 40 years
The author is speaking as if the **land** on which the Israelites lived were a living thing that **rested** after a foreign occupier was driven away. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And there were no more wars for 40 years”

Acts 21:3
the ship was unloading {its} cargo
Luke is speaking of this **ship** as if it were a living thing that would be **unloading** its own **cargo**. Luke means that the crew of this ship would be doing the unloading. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the ship’s crew was to unload its cargo”

Pastforfuture

Judges 7:9
I have given it into your hand
Yahweh is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense in your translation and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I will certainly give it into your hand”

Isaiah 5:13
my people have gone into captivity
Yahweh is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense in your translation and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “my people will certainly go into captivity”

RQuestion

Luke 10:40
Lord, are you not concerned that my sister has left me alone to serve?
Martha is complaining that Jesus is allowing Mary to sit listening to him when there is so much work to do. Martha respects the Lord, so she uses a rhetorical question to make her complaint more polite. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate her words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Lord, it seems as if you do not care that my sister has left me alone to serve.”

Revelation 17:7
Why are you wondering?
The angel is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You do not need to wonder!”

Simile

7:12
like the locust in multitude
The point of this comparison is that just as a **locust** swarm is very great **in multitude**, that is, extremely numerous, so this combined army had a very great number of soldiers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “in huge numbers, such as in a swarm of locusts”

Luke 17:6
faith like a mustard seed
A **mustard seed** is a very small seed, and so Jesus is using this comparison to mean a very small amount of faith. Alternate translation: “even a tiny amount of faith”

Synecdoche

Luke 9:3
bread
Jesus is using one kind of food, **bread**, to represent food in general. Alternate translation: “food”

Acts 15:7
By my mouth
Peter is using one part of himself, his **mouth**, to represent all of himself in the act of speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “From me”
